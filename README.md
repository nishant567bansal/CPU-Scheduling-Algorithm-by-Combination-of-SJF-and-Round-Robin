# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithm-by-Combination-of-SJF-and-Round-Robin
I implemented a hybrid CPU scheduling algorithm combining Round Robin and Shortest Job First to balance fairness and efficiency. By leveraging burst time in decision-making, the approach reduced waiting and turnaround times, achieving around 50% accuracy in performance estimation.
